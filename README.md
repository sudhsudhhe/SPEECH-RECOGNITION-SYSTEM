Speech-to-Text System Using Pre-Trained Models

Speech-to-text (STT), also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is a technology that converts spoken language into written text. It plays a crucial role in modern applications such as voice assistants, transcription services, automated customer support, and accessibility tools for people with hearing impairments. The purpose of this project is to build a basic yet functional speech-to-text system using pre-trained models, allowing quick and accurate transcription of short audio clips.

This project uses Python as the development language, with two main approaches:

Online (Cloud-based) – Using the SpeechRecognition library with Google Web Speech API.

Offline – Using HuggingFace’s Wav2Vec2 model for local processing.

1. Online Approach using SpeechRecognition
The online version is implemented using the SpeechRecognition Python library. It supports multiple APIs, but in this project, we use Google’s Web Speech API due to its high accuracy and multilingual support. The process begins with loading a short audio clip in supported formats such as WAV, AIFF, or FLAC. The recognizer object reads the audio file and sends it to the API for transcription. The result is returned as plain text. Error handling ensures that the program provides clear feedback if the audio is unclear (UnknownValueError) or if there is a connectivity issue (RequestError). This method is straightforward, requires minimal coding, and delivers fast results, but it depends on internet connectivity.

2. Offline Approach using Wav2Vec2
For scenarios where internet access is unavailable or privacy is a concern, the system can use Wav2Vec2, a pre-trained speech model developed by Facebook AI and available via HuggingFace Transformers. Wav2Vec2 is a deep learning model trained on large amounts of speech data to recognize phonetic patterns. The offline process involves loading the audio file, resampling it to 16 kHz, and passing it through the Wav2Vec2 processor. The model then generates logits, which are decoded into human-readable text. This approach ensures data privacy and independence from cloud services but requires more computational resources.

Key Features of the System

Short Clip Transcription: Works best for clips under 1–2 minutes.

Multiple Input Formats: Supports WAV, AIFF, FLAC for compatibility.

Error Handling: Clear messages for unclear speech or connectivity issues.

Online & Offline Options: Choose between speed and privacy.

Extendable: Can be expanded to support live microphone input, multiple languages, and punctuation restoration.

Applications
This STT system can be applied to multiple real-world use cases:

Lecture and Meeting Notes: Automatically transcribe classroom lectures or team meetings.

Accessibility Tools: Help individuals with hearing impairments read conversations in real-time.

Media Subtitling: Create captions for videos or podcasts.

Voice Commands: Enable voice-based controls in smart applications.

Conclusion
The Speech-to-Text System built in this project demonstrates how pre-trained models can be used to create practical, real-world solutions with minimal development time. By providing both cloud-based and offline options, it caters to a variety of needs — from quick online transcription to privacy-sensitive offline processing. While this implementation focuses on short clips for simplicity, it lays a solid foundation for scaling up to continuous, real-time transcription and multilingual capabilities. This makes it a valuable addition to the CODTECH internship deliverables and an excellent demonstration of applied NLP and audio processing skills.
